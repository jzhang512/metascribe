This must be\nproportioned to the space which is to be filled, and the\nnumber of persons present. Second, a due degree of\nslowness. Third, perfect distinctness of articulation.\nAn attention to these three circumstances is the foun-\ndation of all good reading.\nPAUSES.\nThe next important object of attention in reading, is\nthe due arrangement of pauses. This will be the sub-\nject of the following rules.\nRULE I. The principal pause in every sentence oc-\ncurs at the end, where it is always necessary to suspend\nthe voice, before beginning a new sentence.\nThis is the first and most obvious Rule for pausing.\nAs each sentence may be considered a complete pro-\nposition by itself, it is plain, that in order to distinguish\nit perfectly from that which follows, a certain interval\nmust separate them.

When the subject in a sentence consists of\nmore than one word, it is necessary to pause after it.\nWhen a nominative and a verb come in a sentence\nunattended by adjuncts, no pause is necessary, either\nfor the ear or understanding; thus in the following sen-\ntence-Alexander wept : No pause intervenes between\nthese words, because they convey only two ideas, which\nare apprehended the moment they are pronounced; but\nif these words are amplified by dependent words, as in\nthe following sentence-The great and invincible Alex-\nander, wept for the fate of Darius: Here a pause is\nnecessary between these words, not only that the organs\nmay pronounce the whole with more ease, but that the\ncomplex nominative and verb may, by being separately\nand distinctly exhibited, be more readily and distinctly\nconceived.\nEXAMPLES.\nSincerity and truth form the basis of every virtue.\nThe appearances of security are frequently deceitful.\nThis rule is so far from being unnecessary when we\nare obliged to pause after the verb, that it then becomes\nmore essential.\nEXAMPLE.\nThis account of party patches will, I am afraid, appear improbable\nto those who live at a distance from the fashionable world.\nAddison's Spect. No. 81.\nIf in this sentence we only pause at will, as marked\nby the printer, we shall find the verb swallowed up, as\nit were, by the nominative case, and confounded with\nit; but if we make a short pause both before and after\nit, we shall find every part of the sentence obvious and\ndistinct.\nGo gle", "elapsed_time": 3.3491220474243164, "cost": 0.000519}}

Whatever member intervenes between the\nnominative case and the verb, is of the nature of a paren-\nthesis, and must be separated from both of them by a\nshort pause.\nEXAMPLE.\nWhen the Romans and the Sabines were at war, and just upon\nthe point of giving battle, the women, who were all ed to both of\nthem, interposed with so many tears and entreaties, that they pre-\nvented the mutual slaughter which threatened both parties, and\nunited them together in a firm and lasting peace.
