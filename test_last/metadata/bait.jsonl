Elision.\nGENERAL REMARKS. - The meeting of two vowels at the\nend and beginning of two words appeared to the classic\npoets much less admissible than hiatus in the middle of the\nword. Latin words ending in m were considered as ending\nin a vowel, and those beginning with h were regarded as\nvocalic also.\nHiatus was considered especially harsh in the case of\nshort final syllables or those ending in m, as these were\nspoken more rapidly than the long. Among the short finals,\ne and o in Greek, and ě and i in Latin, had a particularly\nweak sound.\nThe meeting of two like vowels was especially dis-\nagreeable.\nTo avoid hiatus, Elision of the final vowel was employed.\nThis is a false name, for the final vowel except in que, ve,\nne, and the monosyllabic particles in e, as τέ, γέ, δέ, was\nnever completely dropped, but when a long syllable followed\nor was demanded by the metre, the final was combined\nwith the succeeding vowel into a kind of diphthong. If\nthe following vowel was short, the final was so weakened by\nrapid utterance, that it was not considered from a metrical\npoint of view. This last kind of elision was regarded as\nthe harsher. In Greek, the later writers usually drop those\nfinal vowels which are not counted metrically, and mark\ntheir omission by the apostrophe, e.g. οὐλομένην, ἢ μύρι᾿\n᾿Αχαιοῖς. This is faulty in so far as it makes no distinction\nbetween the two different kinds of elision just described,", "elapsed_time": 3.1267919540405273, "cost": 0.0005182}}
